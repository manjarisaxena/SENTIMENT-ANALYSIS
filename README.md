# 📊 Sentiment Analysis Project

## 📝 Project Description
This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of text-based data to determine the sentiment of different entries. It utilizes NLP techniques and sentiment scoring to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File:** `sentiment.csv`
- **Description:** Contains text-based data with corresponding sentiment labels.
- **Purpose:** Analyze the sentiment distribution and gain insights into the overall tone of the dataset.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares text data for analysis.
- 📊 **Sentiment Classification**: Uses NLP techniques to categorize sentiments.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Generates graphs and plots to showcase sentiment trends.
- 🏷 **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies common words associated with each sentiment.

## 🛠 Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run
1. 📥 Clone the repository or download the files.
2. 📂 Place the dataset (`sentiment.csv`) in the working directory.
3. ▶️ Open and run `sentimentanalysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. 📊 Analyze the outputs and visualizations.

## 🔮 Expected Output
- A structured dataset with sentiment classifications.
- Graphs showing sentiment distribution over time.
- Lists of common positive and negative keywords.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- 🤖 Implement machine learning models for better sentiment predictions.
- 🌍 Support multiple languages for analysis.
- 🛠 Improve visualization interactivity.
